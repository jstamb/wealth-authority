        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Cost</h3>

        <p>Delaying retirement savings is the single most expensive mistake you can make. Thanks to compound interest, every year you wait costs exponentially more than the last.</p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-red-500 my-4">
          <p class="text-red-800"><strong>Real Cost Example:</strong></p>
          <p class="text-red-800">Person A starts saving $500/month at age 25.</p>
          <p class="text-red-800">Person B starts saving $500/month at age 35.</p>
          <p class="text-red-800">Both retire at 65 with 7% annual returns.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4 text-red-800">
            <li><strong>Person A at 65:</strong> $1,142,811</li>
            <li><strong>Person B at 65:</strong> $566,764</li>
            <li><strong>Cost of waiting 10 years:</strong> $576,047</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>That 10-year delay costs more than half a million dollars—even though Person B contributed $60,000 during those years.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Fix</h3>

        <strong>If you're young:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Start with whatever you can, even if it's just $50/month</li>
          <li>Automate contributions so you never "forget" to save</li>
          <li>Increase contributions with every raise</li>
          <li>Prioritize retirement over other financial goals initially</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>If you're starting late (40+):</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Maximize catch-up contributions starting at age 50</li>
          <li>Save aggressively—aim for 20-30% of income</li>
          <li>Consider delaying retirement by a few years</li>
          <li>Work with a financial advisor to create an accelerated plan</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> The best time to start was yesterday. The second-best time is today.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Cost</h3>

        <p>If your employer offers a 401(k) match and you're not contributing enough to get it all, you're turning down free money. It's the equivalent of refusing part of your salary.</p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-red-500 my-4">
          <p class="text-red-800"><strong>Real Cost Example:</strong></p>
          <p class="text-red-800">You earn $75,000. Your employer matches 50% of contributions up to 6% of salary.</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4 text-red-800">
            <li>You contribute 3%: You get $1,125 match</li>
            <li>You should contribute 6%: You'd get $2,250 match</li>
            <li><strong>You're leaving $1,125 on the table every year</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-red-800">Over 30 years at 7% return: <strong>You lose $113,409</strong></p>
        </div>

        <p>Studies show that about one-third of workers don't contribute enough to get their full employer match. If you're one of them, you're making a six-figure mistake.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Fix</h3>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li><strong>Know your match:</strong> Check your plan documents or ask HR what percentage you need to contribute</li>
          <li><strong>Contribute at least that amount:</strong> Even if you can't save more, get the full match</li>
          <li><strong>Understand the formula:</strong> Some companies match dollar-for-dollar, others 50 cents on the dollar</li>
          <li><strong>Watch for vesting:</strong> Know when the match becomes yours (typically 1-3 years)</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Priority order:</strong> Getting the full employer match should be your #1 retirement savings priority—even before paying off debt (except high-interest credit cards).</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Cost</h3>

        <p>Many people make one of two allocation mistakes: being too conservative when young (missing growth) or too aggressive when nearing retirement (risking what they've built).</p>

        <strong>Better approaches:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li><strong>Target-date funds:</strong> Automatically adjust allocation as you age</li>
          <li><strong>"Age in bonds" rule:</strong> Keep your age as a percentage in bonds (age 40 = 40% bonds)</li>
          <li><strong>Risk-based buckets:</strong> Divide money into short-term (safe), medium-term (balanced), long-term (aggressive)</li>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Cost</h3>

        <p>Taxes can consume 20-40% of your retirement income if you don't plan strategically. Many people save diligently but forget that Uncle Sam owns a share of their traditional IRA and 401(k).</p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-red-500 my-4">
          <p class="text-red-800"><strong>Real Cost Example:</strong></p>
          <p class="text-red-800">You have $1 million in traditional 401(k), all in the 24% tax bracket:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4 text-red-800">
            <li>What you think you have: $1,000,000</li>

            <li><strong>The IRS owns $240,000</strong></li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p>Additionally, required minimum distributions (RMDs) can push you into higher tax brackets in your 70s, triggering taxation of Social Security benefits and Medicare surcharges.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Fix</h3>

        <strong>Create tax diversification:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li><strong>Traditional accounts:</strong> Tax deduction now, taxed in retirement</li>
          <li><strong>Roth accounts:</strong> No deduction now, tax-free in retirement</li>
          <li><strong>Taxable brokerage:</strong> Flexibility, preferential capital gains rates</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Strategic withdrawal sequence:</strong>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Taxable accounts first (lowest tax impact)</li>
          <li>Traditional IRA/401(k) up to top of current bracket</li>
          <li>Roth accounts last (preserve tax-free growth)</li>
        </ol>

        <strong>Roth conversion opportunities:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Early retirement years before Social Security</li>
          <li>Lower-income years or job transitions</li>
          <li>Convert just enough to fill current tax bracket</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Consider a tax advisor if:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>You have over $500,000 saved</li>

        <p>Healthcare is often the largest and most unpredictable retirement expense. Fidelity estimates that a 65-year-old couple retiring in 2024 will need $315,000 just for healthcare costs—and that doesn't include long-term care.</p>

        <div class="bg-red-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-red-500 my-4">

        <p>For couples, the mistake is even costlier because the survivor benefit is based on the higher earner's amount.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Fix</h3>

        <strong>When to consider delaying:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>You're in good health with family longevity</li>
          <li>You're still working (benefits are reduced if claimed before FRA)</li>
          <li>You have other income sources to bridge the gap</li>
          <li>You're the higher earner in a marriage (protects spouse)</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>When early claiming might make sense:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li>Poor health or short life expectancy</li>
          <li>Desperate financial need with no other options</li>
          <li>You're the lower earner and spouse will wait</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Optimal strategy for couples:</strong>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
          <li><strong>Higher earner:</strong> Delay to 70 to maximize survivor benefit</li>
          <li><strong>Lower earner:</strong> May claim earlier, less impact on survivor benefit</li>
          <li>Use other retirement savings to bridge the gap</li>
        </ul>

        <strong>Breakeven analysis:</strong>

      answer: 'If you could only fix one thing, maximize your employer 401(k) match. It\'s an immediate 50-100% return on investment that you can\'t get anywhere else. After that, increase your contribution percentage by 1% every six months until you\'re saving at least 15% of income.'

      question: 'Is it too late to fix my retirement plan if I\'m already in my 50s?',
      answer: 'Absolutely not. Your 50s are actually when you have the most powerful tools available—catch-up contributions, peak earning years, and potentially lower expenses as kids become independent. You can contribute over $40,000 annually to retirement accounts starting at age 50. Many people successfully build substantial retirement savings in their final 15 working years.'

If you\'re young with under $100,000 saved and a simple situation, self-directed investing with index funds may work fine. The key is honest self-assessment of your knowledge and discipline.'

      answer: 'A common guideline for someone in their mid-50s is 60-70% stocks and 30-40% bonds. However, your specific allocation should consider your risk tolerance, other income sources, health, and total wealth. Some aggressive planners maintain 80% stocks even in retirement, while conservative planners shift to 50/50 earlier. The most important thing is having an intentional allocation and sticking to it through market volatility.'

    {
      question: 'Should I pay off my mortgage before retirement or keep investing?',
      answer: 'This depends on your mortgage interest rate, tax situation, and emotional comfort with debt. Financially: If your mortgage rate is below 4-5%, you\'re likely better off investing extra money (historically, market returns exceed low mortgage rates). Emotionally: Some people sleep better debt-free, and that peace of mind has value. A middle ground is to aim to have your mortgage paid off by age 65-67, balancing financial optimization with security. Never sacrifice retirement contributions to pay off a low-rate mortgage early.'
