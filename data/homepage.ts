          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Essential Credentials</h3>
          <p>| Credential | Meaning | Why It Matters | |-----------|---------|----------------| | CFP (Certified Financial Planner) | Comprehensive planning credential | Rigorous exam, fiduciary duty | | CFA (Chartered Financial Analyst) | Investment analysis expertise | Deep investment knowledge | | CPA/PFS | Tax + financial planning | Tax optimization expertise |</p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Key Questions to Ask</h3>
          <p>1. <strong>Are you a fiduciary?</strong> (Should always be "yes") 2. <strong>How are you compensated?</strong> (Fee-only preferred) 3. <strong>What's your investment philosophy?</strong> 4. <strong>What are your total fees, including fund expenses?</strong> 5. <strong>How often will we meet?</strong></p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Fee Structures Explained</h3>
          <p>| Fee Model | How It Works | Typical Cost | |-----------|-------------|--------------| | Fee-Only (AUM) | Percentage of assets managed | 0.5% - 1.5% annually | | Fee-Only (Flat) | Fixed annual retainer | $3,000 - $15,000/year | | Fee-Only (Hourly) | Pay per consultation | $200 - $500/hour | | Fee-Based | Fees + commissions | Varies (conflicts possible) | | Commission-Only | Paid by product sales | Avoid for objective advice |</p>
          <p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Choose fee-only fiduciary advisors to ensure your interests come first.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">How Much Do You Need to Retire?</h3>
          <p>The general rule: accumulate 10-12x your final salary by retirement age.</p>
          <p>| Final Salary | Target Savings (10x) | Target Savings (12x) | |-------------|---------------------|---------------------| | $75,000 | $750,000 | $900,000 | | $100,000 | $1,000,000 | $1,200,000 | | $150,000 | $1,500,000 | $1,800,000 | | $200,000 | $2,000,000 | $2,400,000 |</p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The 4% Rule</h3>
          <p>Withdraw 4% of your portfolio in year one, then adjust for inflation annually. This approach historically provides a high probability of your money lasting 30 years.</p>
          <p>> <strong>Example</strong>: $1,000,000 portfolio × 4% = $40,000 annual withdrawal</p>
          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Retirement Account Comparison (2025)</h3>
          <p>| Account | Contribution Limit | Catch-Up (50+) | Tax Treatment | |---------|-------------------|----------------|---------------| | 401(k) | $23,500 | +$7,500 | Pre-tax or Roth | | IRA | $7,000 | +$1,000 | Pre-tax or Roth | | HSA (Family) | $8,550 | +$1,000 | Triple tax-free |</p>
          <p><strong>Strategy</strong>: Contribute enough to get your full 401(k) match, then max your IRA, then return to your 401(k).</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Index Funds vs. Active Management</h3>
          <p>Research consistently shows most actively managed funds underperform their benchmark indexes after fees. For most investors, low-cost index funds are the optimal choice:</p>
