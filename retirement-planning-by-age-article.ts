        content: `
          <p>Retirement planning by age isn't one-size-fits-all. Your priorities, risk tolerance, and available strategies change dramatically across decades. A 25-year-old has time to recover from market downturns and benefit from compound growth. A 55-year-old needs to protect accumulated wealth while catching up if behind.</p>

          <p>This guide provides specific, actionable milestones for each decade—from your first job to your retirement party. Whether you're starting early or catching up late, you'll know exactly what to focus on at your current age.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Power of Starting Early</h3>

          <p>Consider two savers:</p>

          <div class="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500 my-4">
            <p class="text-blue-800"><strong>Sarah</strong>: Starts at 25, contributes $6,000/year for 10 years, then stops. Total contributions: $60,000</p>
            <p class="text-blue-800 mt-2"><strong>Michael</strong>: Starts at 35, contributes $6,000/year for 30 years. Total contributions: $180,000</p>
            <p class="text-blue-800 mt-2"><strong>Result at 65 (7% annual return)</strong>: Sarah has $602,000. Michael has $567,000.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Sarah contributed one-third as much but ended with more money. That's the power of compound growth over time. But even if you're starting later, strategic planning can still build substantial retirement wealth.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Primary Goals</h3>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>Establish automatic retirement contributions</li>
            <li>Capture full employer 401(k) match</li>
            <li>Build emergency fund (3-6 months expenses)</li>
            <li>Develop good financial habits</li>
            <li>Take maximum investment risk</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Specific Action Steps</h3>

          <strong>Contribute at least enough for the match</strong>
          <p>If your employer matches 50% of contributions up to 6% of salary, contribute at least 6%. This is an immediate 50% return—better than any investment.</p>

          <strong>Start with 10-15% of gross income</strong>
          <p>If earning $50,000, aim for $5,000-$7,500 annually in retirement savings. The 2025 401(k) limit is $23,500 (under 50), giving you plenty of room to grow into.</p>

          <strong>Choose aggressive investments</strong>
          <p>You have 40+ years until retirement. Allocate 90-100% to stocks (U.S. and international). Short-term volatility doesn't matter when you won't need the money for decades.</p>

          <strong>Open a Roth IRA</strong>
          <p>In your 20s, you're likely in a lower tax bracket than you'll be later. Roth contributions (taxed now, tax-free later) make perfect sense. Contribute $7,000 annually if possible (2025 limit).</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Target Savings Milestone</h3>

          <p><strong>By age 30</strong>: Have 1x your annual salary saved for retirement.</p>

          <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500 my-4">
            <p class="text-green-800"><strong>Example</strong>: Emily, 25, earns $55,000. She contributes 10% ($5,500) to her 401(k) and gets a 3% employer match ($1,650). Total annual contribution: $7,150. With market growth, she'll easily hit $55,000+ saved by 30.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Common Mistakes to Avoid</h3>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>Skipping retirement savings to pay off low-interest student loans faster</li>
            <li>Leaving free employer matching money on the table</li>
            <li>Keeping retirement funds in overly conservative investments</li>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Primary Goals</h3>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>Significantly increase contribution rates</li>
            <li>Balance retirement savings with competing priorities (home, family)</li>
            <li>Maximize tax-advantaged accounts</li>
            <li>Review and optimize investment allocation</li>
            <li>Increase income and redirect raises to savings</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Critical Decade</h3>

          <p>Your 30s are when retirement planning gets real. You're earning more but facing competing demands: buying a home, having children, childcare costs. The key is not choosing between retirement and other goals—it's balancing them strategically.</p>

          <strong>Don't pause retirement contributions</strong>
          <p>Many people stop or reduce retirement savings when buying a house or having kids. This is one of the costliest financial mistakes. Money not invested in your 30s loses 30+ years of compound growth.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Specific Action Steps</h3>

          <strong>Aim for 15% total contribution rate</strong>
          <p>This includes your contribution plus employer match. If you earn $80,000 with a 4% match, contribute 11% yourself ($8,800) to reach 15% total ($12,000).</p>

          <strong>Max out your 401(k) or IRA if possible</strong>
          <p>The 2025 401(k) limit is $23,500. If you can't max out, prioritize in this order:</p>

          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>Contribute enough to get full employer match</li>
            <li>Max out Roth IRA ($7,000 in 2025)</li>
            <li>Return to 401(k) to reach the $23,500 limit</li>
          </ol>

          <strong>Increase contributions with raises</strong>
          <p>Got a 4% raise? Put 2% toward lifestyle, 2% toward retirement. This "raise splitting" lets you save more without feeling deprived.</p>

          <strong>Maintain aggressive allocation</strong>
          <p>Still 30+ years to retirement. Keep 85-90% in stocks. Don't panic-sell during market downturns—these create buying opportunities.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Target Savings Milestones</h3>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li><strong>Age 30</strong>: 1x annual salary</li>
            <li><strong>Age 35</strong>: 2x annual salary</li>
            <li><strong>Age 40</strong>: 3x annual salary</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="bg-blue-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-blue-500 my-4">
            <p class="text-blue-800"><strong>Example</strong>: Marcus, 35, earns $90,000. He should have approximately $180,000 saved for retirement. He has $175,000, putting him slightly ahead of schedule. By increasing his 401(k) contribution from 8% to 12%, he'll easily exceed the 3x target by 40.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Balancing Home Purchase and Retirement</h3>

          <p>You can borrow for a house. You can't borrow for retirement. Prioritize retirement contributions even while saving for a down payment. Consider:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>Smaller down payment (5-10%) to maintain retirement savings</li>
            <li>Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn penalty-free for first home purchase (up to $10,000 earnings, all contributions)</li>
            <li>Don't raid your 401(k) for down payment—taxes and penalties destroy value</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Primary Goals</h3>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>Maximize retirement contributions before catch-up eligibility</li>
            <li>Ensure you're on track with savings benchmarks</li>
            <li>Reassess risk tolerance and adjust allocation</li>
            <li>Plan for college expenses without sacrificing retirement</li>
            <li>Review beneficiaries and estate planning</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Acceleration Phase</h3>

          <p>Your 40s represent peak earning years for many professionals. Children may be becoming more independent, reducing childcare costs. This is your window to dramatically accelerate retirement savings before catch-up contribution rules begin at 50.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Specific Action Steps</h3>

          <strong>Aim to max out 401(k) contributions</strong>
          <p>If earning $120,000+, target the full $23,500 annual 401(k) contribution (2025). This equals 19.6% of a $120,000 salary—aggressive but achievable at peak earnings.</p>

          <strong>Contribute to both 401(k) and IRA</strong>
          <p>Maximum combined savings: $30,500 annually ($23,500 to 401(k) + $7,000 to IRA). This aggressive approach can make up for modest savings in your 20s and 30s.</p>

          <strong>Adjust investment allocation</strong>
          <p>Still 15-25 years to retirement. Maintain 75-85% stocks, beginning a gradual shift toward bonds. This preserves growth potential while slightly reducing volatility.</p>

          <strong>Catch up if behind</strong>
          <p>Use this benchmark: By 45, you should have 4x your salary saved. Behind schedule? Strategies to catch up:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>Contribute windfalls (bonuses, inheritances, tax refunds) directly to retirement</li>
            <li>Downsize housing to reduce expenses and increase savings rate</li>
            <li>Take on side income specifically for retirement contributions</li>
            <li>Delay retirement age by a few years (huge impact on final numbers)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Target Savings Milestones</h3>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li><strong>Age 40</strong>: 3x annual salary</li>
            <li><strong>Age 45</strong>: 4x annual salary</li>
            <li><strong>Age 50</strong>: 6x annual salary</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="bg-green-50 p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-green-500 my-4">
            <p class="text-green-800"><strong>Example</strong>: Jennifer, 48, earns $135,000. She should have approximately $810,000 saved (6x salary). She has $720,000. By maxing out her 401(k) ($23,500) and IRA ($7,000) for two years until she turns 50, then utilizing catch-up contributions, she'll surpass her target.</p>
          </div>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">College vs. Retirement: Make the Right Choice</h3>

          <p>If you have college-bound children, you face a critical decision. The guidance is clear but difficult:</p>

          <strong>Prioritize retirement over college savings</strong>

          <p>Students can get loans and scholarships. You can't get a loan for retirement. A better strategy:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>Maintain full retirement contributions</li>
            <li>Explore lower-cost college options (community college, state schools)</li>
            <li>Have your student contribute through work-study and summer jobs</li>
            <li>Use moderate student loans if needed</li>
            <li>Help repay loans later if your retirement is secure</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Sacrificing retirement to fully fund college often backfires—you end up depending on your children later, creating a worse burden.</p>

            </table>
          </div>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Specific Action Steps</h3>

          <strong>Utilize full catch-up contributions</strong>
          <p>At 50, immediately increase 401(k) contributions to $31,000 annually if financially possible. Over 10 years (50-60), this alone contributes $310,000, plus growth.</p>

          <strong>Tax advantage example</strong>
          <p>If in the 24% tax bracket, $31,000 in 401(k) contributions saves $7,440 in current taxes. That's money you can redirect to additional savings or debt payoff.</p>

          <strong>Adjust asset allocation</strong>
          <p>Gradually shift from aggressive to moderate allocation:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li><strong>Age 50</strong>: 70-80% stocks, 20-30% bonds</li>
            <li><strong>Age 55</strong>: 65-75% stocks, 25-35% bonds</li>
            <li><strong>Age 60</strong>: 60-70% stocks, 30-40% bonds</li>
          </ul>

          <p>This preserves growth while protecting against major downturns close to retirement.</p>

          <strong>Eliminate high-interest debt</strong>
          <p>Credit cards, car loans, personal loans—pay these off aggressively. Debt in retirement limits your income flexibility and increases stress.</p>

          <strong>Consider mortgage payoff</strong>
          <p>Having a paid-off home by retirement dramatically reduces required retirement income. If you have 10-15 years left on your mortgage, consider accelerating payments.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Target Savings Milestones</h3>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">

          <p>Starting serious retirement savings in your 50s is late but not hopeless. Strategies for rapid catch-up:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li><strong>Maximize catch-up contributions</strong>: This alone builds substantial wealth over 15 years</li>
            <li><strong>Work longer</strong>: Delaying retirement from 65 to 68 has triple benefit—more years to save, more years for growth, fewer years drawing down</li>
            <li><strong>Reduce expenses now</strong>: Practice living on less to both save more and prepare for lower retirement income</li>
            <li><strong>Delay Social Security</strong>: Each year you wait from 62 to 70 increases benefits by 7-8%</li>
            <li><strong>Consider part-time work in retirement</strong>: Even modest income reduces portfolio withdrawal needs</li>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">The Transition Decade</h3>

          <p>Your 60s mark the shift from accumulation to distribution. Strategic decisions made now determine your financial security for the next 30+ years.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Specific Action Steps</h3>

          <strong>Continue catch-up contributions until retirement</strong>
          <p>If still working, maintain maximum contributions. These final years of tax-advantaged savings and compound growth are valuable.</p>

          <strong>Target milestone: 10x salary by 67</strong>
          <p>If you've followed savings guidelines, you should have approximately 10x your final salary saved by full retirement age. This typically supports a sustainable 4% withdrawal rate replacing about 40% of income, combined with Social Security.</p>

          <strong>Decide Social Security timing</strong>
          <p>This is one of your most important retirement decisions:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li><strong>Claim at 62</strong>: Receive reduced benefits (about 30% less than full retirement age)</li>
            <li><strong>Claim at Full Retirement Age (67 for most)</strong>: Receive 100% of benefits</li>
            <li><strong>Delay until 70</strong>: Receive 124% of full retirement age benefits</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Delaying is often optimal if you have other income sources or sufficient savings. Every year you wait from 67 to 70 increases your lifetime monthly benefit by 8%.</p>

          <strong>Plan healthcare coverage</strong>

          <p>If retiring before 65 (Medicare eligibility), you need coverage:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li>COBRA continuation coverage (18 months)</li>
            <li>Spouse's employer plan</li>
            <li>ACA marketplace insurance</li>
            <li>Part-time work with benefits</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Budget $800-$1,500/month per person for individual coverage until Medicare.</p>

          <strong>Enroll in Medicare at 65</strong>

          <p>Even if still working, enroll in Medicare Part A (free) at 65 to avoid penalties. Evaluate Parts B, D, and supplemental coverage based on your health and financial situation.</p>

          <strong>Adjust investment allocation</strong>

          <p>Protect accumulated wealth while maintaining growth:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li><strong>Early 60s (still working)</strong>: 60% stocks, 40% bonds</li>
            <li><strong>At retirement</strong>: 50% stocks, 50% bonds/cash</li>
            <li><strong>Late 60s and beyond</strong>: 40-50% stocks, 50-60% bonds/cash</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Maintain some stock exposure to combat inflation over a 30-year retirement.</p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Creating Your Withdrawal Strategy</h3>

          <strong>The 4% Rule</strong>
          <p>A common starting point: Withdraw 4% of your portfolio in year one of retirement, then adjust for inflation annually. A $1 million portfolio supports about $40,000/year.</p>

          <strong>Tax-efficient withdrawal order:</strong>

          <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li><strong>Taxable accounts first</strong>: These have lower tax rates on capital gains</li>
            <li><strong>Tax-deferred accounts (Traditional 401(k)/IRA)</strong>: Spread withdrawals to manage tax bracket</li>
            <li><strong>Tax-free accounts (Roth)</strong>: Preserve these longest for tax-free growth and flexibility</li>
          </ol>

          <strong>Understand Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</strong>
          <p>Starting at age 73, you must withdraw minimum amounts from Traditional 401(k)s and IRAs annually. Failure triggers a 25% penalty on the amount not withdrawn. Plan ahead to manage the tax impact.</p>

            <p class="text-green-800"><strong>Example</strong>: Patricia, 66, has $1.2 million saved (8x her final $150,000 salary). She plans to claim Social Security at 70 for maximum benefits ($3,800/month). Until then, she'll withdraw 4% from her portfolio ($48,000) to cover expenses. At 70, her combined income will be Social Security ($45,600/year) plus portfolio withdrawals ($40,000), totaling $85,600—57% of her pre-retirement income, supplemented by a paid-off home and no commuting costs.</p>

          <p>Starting retirement savings seriously in your 40s or 50s requires aggressive action but can still work:</p>

          <strong>Mega savings rate</strong>
          <p>If you start at 45 with nothing saved, contributing 25-30% of income can still build substantial wealth by 67. This requires lifestyle sacrifice but remains achievable.</p>

          <strong>Defer retirement</strong>
          <p>Working until 70 instead of 65 provides five extra years of contributions and growth, plus significantly higher Social Security benefits.</p>

          <strong>Geographic arbitrage</strong>
          <p>Consider retiring in a lower cost-of-living area or state (or country) to stretch retirement savings further.</p>

          <p>Planning to retire in your 40s or 50s requires different strategies:</p>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 my-4">
            <li><strong>Higher savings rate</strong>: Often 50-70% of income</li>

            <li><strong>Roth conversion ladder</strong>: Strategy to access Traditional IRA funds penalty-free</li>
            <li><strong>Healthcare planning</strong>: Major expense for decades before Medicare</li>
            <li><strong>Rule of 55</strong>: Access 401(k) penalty-free if you leave job at 55+</li>

      {
        question: 'What if I\'m behind the savings benchmarks for my age?',
        answer: 'First, don\'t panic—you have options. Immediately increase your contribution rate, especially maximizing employer match. At 50+, use catch-up contributions ($7,500 extra to 401(k), $1,000 to IRA). Consider working 2-5 years longer than planned—this has a triple benefit: more years to save, more compound growth, and fewer years drawing down savings. Finally, reassess retirement expenses. Many people spend 20-30% less in retirement than they expected.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Should I prioritize retirement savings or paying off debt?',
        answer: 'It depends on the interest rate. Always contribute enough to get full employer match (it\'s free money). For high-interest debt (credit cards above 15%), pay that off aggressively while maintaining the match. For moderate debt (4-7% student loans or car loans), split the difference—contribute to retirement while making extra debt payments. For low-interest debt (sub-4% mortgage), prioritize retirement savings since investment returns typically exceed the interest cost over time.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How much should I have in my 401(k) vs IRA?',
        answer: 'There\'s no set ratio—both are tools in your overall strategy. Generally, contribute to 401(k) first to get the full employer match, then max out a Roth IRA for tax diversification and investment flexibility. If you can save more, return to maxing out the 401(k). By retirement, you might have more in your 401(k) simply due to higher contribution limits ($31,000 vs $8,000 at 50+) and employer matching, but having both provides tax and withdrawal flexibility.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I retire early if I save aggressively in my 30s and 40s?',
        answer: 'Yes, but it requires planning for the gap years before you can access retirement accounts penalty-free at 59½. Strategies include: saving in taxable brokerage accounts you can access anytime; building a Roth IRA ladder to convert Traditional IRA funds; using Rule of 72(t) substantially equal periodic payments; or the Rule of 55 if leaving a job at 55+. Early retirement also requires careful healthcare planning until Medicare at 65, which can cost $1,000+ monthly per person.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s more important: saving percentage or dollar amount?',
        answer: 'In your younger years (20s-30s), percentage matters most. Saving 15% of a $50,000 salary ($7,500) builds the discipline and habits that scale with your income. As you age and earn more (40s-50s), focus on dollar amounts—maximizing contribution limits like $31,000 to a 401(k) and $8,000 to an IRA. The combination of consistent percentage-based saving early and maximum dollar contributions later creates optimal wealth accumulation.'
      },
    ],
    bottomLine: 'Successful retirement planning by age requires different strategies at each life stage. In your 20s and 30s, prioritize building the habit of consistent contributions and capturing employer matches—even modest amounts compound significantly over decades. Your 40s represent the acceleration phase: maximize contributions and catch up if you\'re behind. At 50+, aggressive use of catch-up contributions can dramatically boost retirement readiness. And in your 60s, shift from accumulation to distribution planning—optimizing Social Security timing, managing healthcare, and creating sustainable withdrawal strategies. The most important insight: it\'s never too early to start, and it\'s rarely too late to improve your situation. Whether you\'re right on track, ahead of schedule, or playing catch-up, having a clear age-appropriate strategy ensures you\'re making the most of every remaining year before retirement. If you\'re uncertain about your retirement readiness or need help creating an age-specific strategy, a financial advisor can analyze your situation and develop a personalized plan that accounts for your income, expenses, goals, and timeline.'
